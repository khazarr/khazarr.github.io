Imagine you have to create a reusable element that will be widely used across your project (or even multiple projects). Before I know about Web Components the natural way of achieving this would be creating a component in some framework (like Vue or React). Then you could easily reuse it.

But there is a *native* browser way of solving this problem. It's called Web Components. Let's create a custom element that could take some content and animate it. It will be similar to what Vue's slots offer.

Let's start with basics:
```html
  <animal-img>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7211/7338309360_b0a61cf73b_b.jpg">
  </animal-img>
```
I have created ```<animal-img>``` tag and put an image inside. At this moment it will be displayed normally by a browser. And our custom DOM element will be present in the inspector tab.

As I found you should name your custom web components using **lowercase** and a **dash** because there is no basic HTML tag containing dash.

But let's actually make it a working HTML element

```javascript
  class AnimalImg extends HTMLElement {
    constructor () {
      super()
    }
  }
  customElements.define('animal-img', AnimalImg)
```

At this point, our component can behave like a normal HTML tag. You can attach an event listener, or use some methods like ```appendChild```. Our output does not change. We still can see a racoon image

Ok now let's make a slight change in our AnimalImg class:
```javascript
  class AnimalImg extends HTMLElement {
    constructor () {
      super()
      this.attachShadow({
        mode: 'open'
      })
    }
  }
```
At this moment image will dissappear, and we have just created a shadow-root. Let's imagine this that your content will be hidden at the beginning, but you can later display it in a way you want.

Now we need to create our slot and add it to our Web Component to be able to display what is hidden under ```#shadow-root```. What is really cool we can add a custom CSS inside ```<style>``` tag and it will be scoped inside our component!

```javascript
const template = document.createElement('template')
template.innerHTML = '<style>:host {display:inline-block} </style><slot/>'
```

Then we need to append this slot to an instance of Web Component. Let's see how our class looks now.

```javascript
  class AnimalImg extends HTMLElement {
    constructor () {
      super()
      this.attachShadow({
        mode: 'open'
      })
    }
    connectedCallback () {
      this.shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true))
    }
  }
```

Let's focus now on a method ```connectedCallback()```. It's something similar to Vue's ```created()``` or React's ```componentDidMount``` lifecycle methods. It allows running some Javascript when the element is connected to DOM. Similarly, we have ```disconnectedCallback``` in Web Components API which is invoked when element will be disconnected.

So our image will now be visible. And in the elements tab of browser's inspector, you can see a symlink to an image hidden in shadow-root.

That's great! We can now add some cool animations to our image and have a working component.

```javascript
  class AnimalImg extends HTMLElement {
    constructor () {
      super()
      this.attachShadow({
        mode: 'open'
      })
    }
    connectedCallback () {
      this.shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true))
      this.animate([
        { transform: 'scale(0) rotate(0)' },
        { transform: 'scale(1) rotate(360deg)' }
      ], {
        duration: 1000,
        easing: 'cubic-bezier(0,0,0.3,1)'
      })
    }
  }
```
The ```this``` refers to current instnace of our ```<animal-img>``` tag. Below you can see a working example on codepen.
